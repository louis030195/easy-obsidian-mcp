# create-easy-obsidian-mcp

⚠️ **DEPRECATED** ⚠️

This package is now deprecated. Please use the simpler installation method:

```bash
npx easy-obsidian-mcp@latest
```

This new method provides the same functionality with a much simpler installation process.

## Why the change?

- ✅ Simpler installation (one package instead of two)
- ✅ No need to create local directories
- ✅ Always uses the latest version
- ✅ Easier to maintain

## Migration

If you were using `npx create-easy-obsidian-mcp`, simply switch to:

```bash
npx easy-obsidian-mcp@latest
```

The setup process and configuration options remain the same.
